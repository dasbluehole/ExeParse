# ExeParse
An EXE file parser. It can show info Dos Header, NE header, LX header and PE header
Though There is nothing new, To utilize my time in LockDown i wrote it. This can be compiled using GCC. I tried it on Fedora 31. Hope it will work on any other systems too.
for compilation plese write your own Makefile or a shell script ;)
